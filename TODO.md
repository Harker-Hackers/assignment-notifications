1. Create a main page. This page should have the current courses + links to update courses, as well as a place to input the disc id
2. Make the schoolopyauth work individually per person (DONE)
3. Make a page for logged in users only. The authenticated url should link to this page. There will be a button to add courses (both ways) and a button to get the assignments.
